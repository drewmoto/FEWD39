                  <p>David Bowie has died many deaths yet he is still with us.
                    He is popular music’s ultimate Lazarus: Just as that Biblical figure was beckoned by Jesus to
                    emerge from his tomb after four days of nothingness, Bowie has put many of his selves to rest over
                    the last half-century, only to rise again with a different guise. </p>

                  <p>This is astounding to watch, but it's more treacherous to live through; following Lazarus’ return, priests plotted to kill him, fearing the power of his story </p>

        <h2>Black</h2>
        <p>Bowie knows all this. He will always have to answer to his epochal work of the 1970s, the decade in which he dictated several strands of popular and experimental culture, when he made reinvention seem as easy as waking up in the morning. </p>

        <p>His new off-Broadway musical is called Lazarus, and it turns Bowie’s penchant for avatars into an intriguing shell game: The disjointed production features actor Michael C. Hall doing his best impression of Bowie’s corrupted, drunk, and immortal alien from the 1976 art film The Man Who Fell to Earth </p>
